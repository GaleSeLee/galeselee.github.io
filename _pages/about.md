I am a first-year CS Ph.D. at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guang Zhou) under the instruction from Professor [Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen). I received my B.S. at Peking University advised by Professor [Jie Zhang](https://www.chaselab.wiki/) and [Chao Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yangch/english/index.html).

I am interested in high performance computing(HPC), especially GPU computing and making machine learning system more efficient(MLSys). If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
